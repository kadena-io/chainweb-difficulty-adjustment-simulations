# Simulation of Difficulty Algorithms for Chainweb

The simulation model supports different difficulty adjustment algorithms for
network with more than a single hash function. It also support scenarios where
chains start out with different difficulties.

Currently, only simulation results for networks with a single hash algorithm and
identical initial difficulties for all chains are included.
